# Drag-and-Drop Submission Tool

Studies, samples and data files can all be submitted in a single step using our drag-and-drop uploader tool. Metadata for all object types is provided in a single spreadsheet and uploaded along with your data files. A user support bioinformatician at the ENA will pick up your files and perform the submission on your behalf.

```{warning}
Please note : due to the manual nature, this tool is only suitable for infrequent submission of small-to-meduim-scale datasets. For frequent or larger scale submissions, please consider another method covered in this workshop.
```

## Steps

- Register your interest in using this tool by filling in [this form](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/submit-data/viral-sequence-form), providing us with some basic details about your dataset. If the tool is suitable for your assign your use case, a secure key will be assigned to you and we will send a metadata spreadsheet template.

- Populate the spreadsheet template with your own metadata. Please find a version of this spreadsheet populated using the example data we've used throughout this workshop in the `example_data/drag_and_drop` folder.

- Log in to your upload area through our [uploader webpage](https://ebi-ait.github.io/sars-cov2-data-upload/) using your secure key.
